Hello Everyone
This is a readme file for my first Odin Project PROJECT! Yay me!
In this project, I want to create a website using HTML features I've learned with Odin Project.
It's basically a starter project to practice the HTML that I've learned so far. 
It is not meant to be pretty as I have not learned much CSS or JS but over the course of the class, I hopefully will learn about this programming languaging and spruce up this project.
Thank you for reading and have a great day.
#Test Comment
Really everyone could be #but there is not going to be any coding in this Readme so it is somewhat moot.

Self Reflection may go after here.
